Box1 run on Thu Sep 22 19:37:56 EDT 2016
----------------------------------------------
When Box1 x and Box1 y are first created, both a and b for both objects are the default value of 0, as shown below: 
x.getA():0
x.getB(): 0
y.getA(): 0
y.getB(): 0
------------------------------
However, when both A and B are changed for Box1 x via x.setA(25) and x.setB(25), the only variable that changes for Box1 y is b.
x.getA() after x.setA(25): 25
x.getB() after x.setA(25): 25
y.getA() after x.setA(25): 0
y.getB() after x.setA(25): 25
SOLUTION: a is the instance variable, because changing a for Box1 x does not change a for Box1 y. This means that both objects have their own instance of variable a. b is the static variable, because when B is changed for Box1 x via x.setB(), it also changes the result of y.getB(), proving they point to the same variable.
