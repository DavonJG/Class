Question 6.1
4 HelloThreads are created.

Question 6.2
Each HelloThread loops 99 times. The threads are randomly interrupted as they are looping.

Question 9.1.1
The program did not produce the result as intended because as the threads were running and placing numbers into the sharedBuffer[] indexes, they were being interrupted which resulted in 1's, 2's, 3's, and 4's being placed in the wrong ranges.
